# Redirects are cached in 'lib/redirects/.redirects-cache.json'. If changes made here are not being reflected
# on your local server, delete the cache file by running the following command, then restart your server.
#
#   rm lib/redirects/.redirects-cache.json

# These urls are exceptions to the default versioning fallbacks (described in lib/all-versions.js).
# Originally shipped in pull #20947 on 10/15/21

# "About Premium Support" is the combination of three older articles and is now versioned for GHEC and GHES. As it is still
# linked from site policy and the UI, this ensures those version-less URLs redirect correctly.
# Shipped in #23217
