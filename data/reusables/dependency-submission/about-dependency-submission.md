The Dependency submission API lets you submit dependencies for a project to generate a dependency graph. This enables you to integrate dependencies that are resolved when software is compiled or built with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s dependency graph feature. For more information about viewing the dependency graph, see "[Exploring the dependencies of a repository](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#viewing-the-dependency-graph)." Submitted dependencies will receive {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} for any known vulnerabilities.

Manifest or lock files in a repository that declare dependencies (for example, a `package-lock.json` file in a JavaScript project) will still be detected and parsed to populate the repository's dependency graph.
