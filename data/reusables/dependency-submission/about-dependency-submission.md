The Dependency submission API lets you submit dependencies for a project to generate a dependency graph. This enables you to integrate dependencies that are resolved when software is compiled or built with {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s dependency graph feature. For more information about viewing the dependency graph, see "[Exploring the dependencies of a repository](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#viewing-the-dependency-graph)." Submitted dependencies will receive {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} for any known vulnerabilities.

The dependency graph shows any dependencies you submit using the API in addition to any dependencies that are identified from manifest or lock files in the repository (for example, a `package-lock.json` file in a JavaScript project).
