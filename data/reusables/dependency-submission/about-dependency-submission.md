The Dependency submission API lets you submit dependencies for a project to generate a dependency graph. This enables you to generate a dependency graph for projects that resolve dependencies when the software is built or compiled. For more information about viewing the dependency graph, see "[Exploring the dependencies of a repository](/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository#viewing-the-dependency-graph)." Submitted dependencies will receive {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_security_updates %} for any known vulnerabilities.

Projects that declare their dependencies in a file that is committed to the repository (for example, a `package-lock.json` file in a JavaScript project) do not need to use the Dependency submission API in order to generate a dependency graph. However, these projects can still use the Dependency submission API.
