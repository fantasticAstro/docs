When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token (PAT) instead. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token](/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)." {% ifversion not ghae %} Note that password-based authentication has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. Instead, use the aforementioned PAT or a credential helper like [Git Credential Manager](https://aka.ms/gcm). {% endif %}
