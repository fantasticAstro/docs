Coordinated vulnerability disclosure is an area where collaboration between vulnerability reporters and project maintainers is very important, from the moment a potentially harmful security vulnerability is found, right until a vulnerability is disclosed to the world, ideally with a patch available. Typically, when someone lets a maintainer know privately about a security vulnerability, the maintainer develops a fix, validates it, and notifies the users of the project or package.
