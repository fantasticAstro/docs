Vulnerability disclosure is an area where collaboration between security researchers and organizations is very important, from the moment a potentially harmful security vulnerability is found, right until a patch is available, and the vulnerability is disclosed to the world. Typically, when someone lets an organization maintainer know privately about a security vulnerability, the maintainer develops a fix, validates it, and notifies the repository users.
