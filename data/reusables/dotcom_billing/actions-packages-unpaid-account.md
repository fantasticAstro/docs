If your account has outstanding unpaid charges:

* The storage or minutes included in your account for {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_actions }} and {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_registry }} will not be reset until the payment has been successfully processed.
* For accounts with storage or minutes remaining for the current billing period, {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_actions }} and {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_registry }} will continue to be available until any included usage has been reached.
* For accounts that have reached the included usage for the current billing period for {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_actions }} or {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_registry }}, both {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_actions }} and {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_registry }} will be disabled to prevent any further overages. If you pay your account by invoice, you must [contact our account management team](https://enterprise.github.com/contact) to process payment and reset your usage.
