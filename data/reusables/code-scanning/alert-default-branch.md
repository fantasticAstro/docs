The status and information on the alert  page will only reflect the state of the alert on the default branch, even if an alert exists in other branches of the repository. You can see the status of the alert on non-default branches in the **Affected branches** section in the right-hand sidebar of the alert  page. If an alert does not exist in the default branch, the status of the alert will display as "in pull request" or "in branch" and the status label will be colored grey.
