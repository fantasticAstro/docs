If the same alert has been generated by more than one configuration of code scanning in your repository, the name of the configuration, called an analysis origin, displays on the alert page for each instance of the alert. This allows you to distinguish between duplicate alerts with different origins. For more information, see "[About analysis origins](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-analysis-origins)."
