Each configuration of code scanning in your repository is called an analysis origin. If an alert has multiple analysis origins, you can view the status of the alert for each analysis origin on the alert page. For more information, see "[About analysis origins](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-analysis-origins)."
