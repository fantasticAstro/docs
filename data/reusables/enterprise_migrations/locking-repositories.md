{% tip %}

**Note:** Locking a repository prevents all access to the noted repository. New teams and collaborators can't be associated with a locked repository. 

If you're performing a trial run, you don't need to lock repositories. Otherwise, it's highly recommended. For more information, see "[About Migrations](/enterprise/admin/migrations/about-migrations#types-of-migrations)."
