**Public packages:** To prevent confusion and build problems, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} permanently reserves a package's name and version number. Even if an entire package is deleted, you cannot reuse the deleted package name in any repository owned by the same account.

**Private packages:** If all versions of a private package are deleted, the user can re-create the package with any version number they want. When all versions of a package have been deleted, republishing over those deleted versions (i.e. publishing a package with the same name and version) should be the same as publishing a new package for the first time.

To revise or replace a package version, we recommend you publish a new version of your package.
