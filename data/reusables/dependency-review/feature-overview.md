Dependency review helps you understand dependency changes and the security impact of these changes at every pull request. It provides an easily understandable visualization of dependency changes with a rich diff on the "Files Changed" tab of a pull request. Dependency review informs you of:
- which dependencies were added, removed, or updated, along with the release dates, 
- how many projects use these components, 
- vulnerability data for these dependencies.
