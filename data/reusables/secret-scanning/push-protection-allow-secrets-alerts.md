When you allow a secret to be pushed, an alert is created in the "Security" tab. The alert is closed and no notifications are sent if you specify that the secret is a false positive or used only in tests. If you specify that the secret is real and that you will fix it later, the security alert remains open and notifications are sent to the author of the commit and repository administrators. For more information, see "[Managing alerts from secret scanning](/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning)."
