**Note**: Team Discussions will be deprecated in GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.10, in favor of GitHub Discussions. You can transfer your existing team discussions to a repository's discussions by using a migration tool that allows team admins to migrate both public and private team discussions. Click the "Transfer" button in the banner at the top of your team discussions page, then choose the repository in your organization that you want to migrate the discussions to. 

For more information on GitHub Discussions, see "[AUTOTITLE](/discussions)."
