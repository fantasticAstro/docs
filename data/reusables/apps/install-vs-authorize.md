When you install a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} on your account or organization, you grant the app permission to access the organization and repository resources that it requested. You also specify which repositories the app can access.

When you authorize a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} you grant the app access to your GitHub account, based on the account permissions the app requested. You also grant the app permission to act on your behalf.

You can install a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} without authorizing the app. Similarly, you can authorize the app without installing the app.
