      MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning. The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored.

      When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, and the process may not complete.
  changes:
    - |
      Added a pre-upgrade check to validate the GHES version and MySQL configuration before allowing an upgrade to 3.9.
    - |
      Adjusted the timeout threshold for shutting down MySQL to prevent premature termination when upgrading to GHES 3.9.
