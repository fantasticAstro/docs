  bugs:
    - Prevents duplication of admin SSH keys showing up in Management Console and admin/.ssh/authorized_keys 
    - Some background tasks could deadlock preventing them from making progress caused by `enterprise-crypto` which has now been modified to be thread safe. 
  changes:
    - Performance improvements to the GitHub Enterprise Support Bundle generation process. This modifies the `sanitize_logs` function in `ghe-support-bundle` to run `psed` in parallel vs. serially.  This is based on an analysis of bundle generation on `ghe.io` where it was observed we spent 36% of our time in `psed` sanitizing logs. 
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with {% data variables.product.prodname_github_connect %}, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
