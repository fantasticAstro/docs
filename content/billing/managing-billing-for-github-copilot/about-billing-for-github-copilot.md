Brief conceptual article explaining:
- Copilot is a paid feature
- free for verified open source maintainers and students
– $10 a month or $100 a year
– if you are not eligible for free use, you can use a 60 day free trial, but you need to add billing details and decide whether you want monthly or yearly subscription after the free trial.
– If you cancel the free trial before the 60 days are up, you won't be charged, otherwise you will be charged according to your billing selection
