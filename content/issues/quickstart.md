## Introduction
You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories, issues, project boards, and other tools to plan and track your work, whether working on an individual project or large initiative.

In this guide, you will learn how to create and set up a repository for collaborating with a team, create issue forms and templates, open issues and use task lists to break down work, and establish a project board for tracking issues.

## Creating a repository
When starting a new project, initiative or feature, the first step is to create a repository. Repositories contain all of your project's files and are also the place where you can collaborate with others and manage your work. For more information, see "[Creating a new repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-new-repository)".

You can set up repositories in a variety of ways based on how your organization is structured. The following are some common use cases and types of repositories:
- **Product repositories**: For a larger organization that tracks their work and goals based on specific products, there may be one or more repositories containing the code and other files. These repositories can also be used for documentation, reporting on product health or future plans for the product. 
- **Project repositories**: For an organization that tracks work for short-lived initiatives or projects, such as a consulting firm, there is a need to report on the health of a project and move people between different projects based on skills and needs. Code for the project is often contained in a single repository.
- **Team repositories**: For an organization that keeps groups of people together in teams, and brings projects to them, such as a dev tools team, code may be scattered across many repositories for the different work they need to track. In this case it may be helpful to have a team-specific repository as one place to track all the work the team is involved in.

You can create multiple, separate repositories if you want different access permissions for the source code and for tracking issues and discussions. For more information, see "[Creating an issues-only repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-an-issues-only-repository)".

## Creating a team or project README

You can create a README file for your repository to introduce your team or project and communicate important information about it. A README is often the first item a visitor to your repository will see, so you can also provide information on how users or contributors can get started with the project and how to contact the team. For more information, see "[About READMEs](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-readmes)".

You can also create a CONTRIBUTING.MD file specifically to contain guidelines on how users or contributors can contribute and interact with the team or project, such as how to open a bug fix issue or request an improvement. For more information, see "[Setting guidelines for repository contributors](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors)".

## Making decisions as a team
Best practices for how to formulate goals
Maybe link out to issues vs. discussions content?
Communicating in issues for full transparency on day-to-day tasks

## Creating issue forms and templates
Types of issues to track different types of work, depending on the type of repo youâ€™re working in (something people wish they learned earlier)
Definitive examples of types of issues teams can use to gather information from each other and other teams
 - day of launch issues, main tracking issues, bug fix issues, etc.

## Opening issues and using task lists to track scoped work
Using smaller issues to break work up
Using task lists to track that work

## Using labels to track project goals and status

## Adding issues to a Projects Beta board
Link to the new Projects beta quickstart which is also in the release branch. Also mention the project boards currently.
