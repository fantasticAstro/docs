## About {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is an AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code. You can receive suggestions from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want a function to do. {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as neighboring or related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. For real-world examples of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} in action, see [{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}](https://copilot.github.com/).

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI. You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} to generate suggestions in numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but it works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. 

When using natural language comments to elicit suggestions, comments written in English are likely to result in more reliable suggestions than comments written in languages other than English. 

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim and the JetBrains suite of IDEs. For more information, see "[Getting started with {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}](/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot)."

## Using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} has been trained on billions of lines of publicly available open source code. As a result, the training set for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} produces suggestions based on this training data, those suggestions may also contain undesirable patterns. 

You are responsible for ensuring the security and quality of your code. We recommend you take the same precautions when using code generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} that you would when using any code you didn't write yourself. These precautions include rigorous testing, copyright analysis, and tracking for security vulnerabilities. {% data variables.product.company_short %} provides a number of features to help you monitor and improve code quality, such as {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} and {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. All these features are free to use in public repositories. For more information, see "[Understanding {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)" and the [Code security](/code-security) documentation.

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %} uses filters to block offensive words in the prompts and avoid producing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We are committed to constantly improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive suggestions generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, including biased, discriminatory, or abusive outputs. If you see an offensive suggestion generated by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot %}, please report it directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards.
