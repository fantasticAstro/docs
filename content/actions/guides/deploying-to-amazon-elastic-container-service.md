### Introduction
[Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) and [Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) are a great combination for running your container-based workloads in the cloud.

This guide will show you how to orchestrate your deployments to Amazon ECR and ECS via GitHub Actions.

The included workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR, and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, on every push to the default branch.

### Prerequisites
To adopt this workflow, you will first need to complete the following setup steps:

#### Create an ECR repository to store your images
For example, using [the AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):

{% raw %}
```bash{:copy}
aws ecr create-repository \
    --repository-name $ECR_REPOSITORY \
    --region $AWS_REGION
```
{% endraw %}

Replace the value of `$ECR_REPOSITORY` in the workflow below with your repository's name.

Replace the value of `$AWS_REGION` in the workflow below with your repository's region.

#### Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service
For details, follow [the Getting Started guide on the ECS console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun).

Replace the values for `$ECS_SERVICE` and `$ECS_CLUSTER` in the workflow below with your service and cluster names.

#### Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository
The format should mirror the output generated by:

{% raw %}
```bash{:copy}
aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton
```
{% endraw %}

Replace the value of `$ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` in the workflow below with your JSON file's name.

Replace the value of `$CONTAINER_NAME` in the workflow below with the name of the container in the containerDefinitions section of the task definition.

#### Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user, and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

### Workflow
After updating the env section, follow these instructions to add the workflow to your repository:

{% raw %}
```bash{:copy}
name: Deploy to Amazon ECS

on:
  release:
    types: [ created ]

env:
  AWS_REGION: your-preferred-aws-region        # set this to your preferred AWS region, e.g. us-west-1
  ECR_REPOSITORY: your-ecr-repository          # set this to your Amazon ECR repository name
  ECS_SERVICE: your-ecs-service                # set this to your Amazon ECS service name
  ECS_CLUSTER: your-ecs-cluster                # set this to your Amazon ECS cluster name
  ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: your-ecs-task-defintion # set this to the path to your Amazon ECS task definition
                                               # file, e.g. .aws/task-definition.json
  CONTAINER_NAME: your-container-name          # set this to the name of the container in the
                                               # containerDefinitions section of your task definition
