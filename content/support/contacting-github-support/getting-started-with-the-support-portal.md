## About the support portal

The GitHub Support portal offers a number of benefits:

* Single Sign-on connected to your GitHub.com account
* Markdown support
* Escalate or close your tickets
* Collaborate with colleagues on your shared tickets
* Manage who in your [enterprise account](/admin/overview/about-enterprise-accounts.md) can open priority tickets and collaborate on shared tickets
