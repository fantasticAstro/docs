## About the support portal

You can use the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} support portal to view and manage support tickets, find markdown support, and manage the users in your enterprise account. The support portal offers SSO connected to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account.

For the best experience using the support portal, we recommend that you do the following:

- Identify the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} user who is an owner of your enterprise account
- Configure a verified domain
- Add owners, billing managers, or suport-entitled members to your enterprise account

As an {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} customer, capabilities available to you in the support portal depend on your role in your enterprise account as well as the account you select when you submit a ticket. Please note that urgent priority and Premium Support SLAs apply only to tickets associated with your enterprise account. Tickets associated with an enterprise account can only be opened by owners, billing managers and support-entitled members.

As an owner, billing manager, or support-entitled member, you can view all tickets associated with your enterprise account or organizations managed by your enterprise account. Under certain conditions, you can also comment on tickets opened by other users and associated to your enterprise account.

**Note:** We strongly recommend setting up at least one verified domain to facilitate collaborating on tickets. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-organization)."
