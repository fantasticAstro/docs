### Part 1: Configuring your {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} account

There are several types of accounts on {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }}. Every person who uses {{ site.data.variables.product.product_location }} has their own user account, which can be part of many organizations and teams. Your user account is your identity on {{ site.data.variables.product.product_location }} and represents you as an individual.

#### Creating an account
To sign up for a {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} account, navigate to https://github.com/ and follow the prompts. 

To keep your {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} account secure you should generate a strong and unique password with more than 16 characters using a password manager, such as [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [1Password](https://1password.com/).

#### Configuring two-factor authentication
Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. We strongly urge you to configure 2FA for the safety of your account. 

{{#note}}

**Note**: When you configure two-factor authentication, download and save your 2FA recovery codes with your password manager. If you lose access to your phone, you can authenticate to {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} using your recovery codes.

{{/note}}

For more information, see "[About two-factor authentication](/github/authenticating-to-github/about-two-factor-authentication)."

#### Viewing your {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} profile and contribution graph
Your {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} profile tells people the story of your work through the repositories and gists you've pinned, the organizations you're part of, the contributions you've made, and the projects you've created. For more information, see “[About your profile](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile)."

Your profile also shows a graph of your public repository contributions over the past year. Additionally, you can choose to show anonymized activity from private repositories. For more information, see “[Viewing contributions on your profile](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile)."

### Part 2: Using tools and processes with {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }}

### Part 3: Collaborating on {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }}
Any number of people can work together in repositories across {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }}. You can configure settings, create project boards, and manage your notifications to encourage effective collaboration.

#### Creating a repository
A repository is like a folder for your project. You can have any number of public and private repositories in your user account. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets, as well as the revision history for all files in the repository. For more information, see "[About repositories](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories)."

When you create a new repository, you should initialize the repository with a README file to let people know about your project. For more information, see “[Creating a new repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)."

#### Importing your projects
If you have existing projects you'd like to move over to {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} you can import projects using the {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} Importer, the command line, or external migration tools. For more information, see “[Importing source code to GitHub](/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github)."

#### Managing collaborators and permissions
You can collaborate on your project with others using your repository's issues, pull requests, and project boards. You can invite other people to your repository as collaborators from the **Collaborators** tab in the repository settings. For more information, see “[Inviting collaborators to a personal repository](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)."

You are the owner of any repository you create in your user account and have full control of the repository. Collaborators have write access to your repository, limiting what they have permission to do. For more information, see “[Permission levels for a user account repository](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository)."

#### Managing repository settings
As the owner of a repository you can configure several settings, including the repository's visibility, topics, and social media preview. For more information, see “[Managing repository settings](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings)."

#### Setting up your project for healthy contributions
To encourage collaborators in your repository, you need a community that encourages people to use, contribute to, and evangelize your project. For more information, see “[Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)" in the Open Source Guides.

By adding files like contributing guidelines, a code of conduct, and a license to your repository you can create an environment where it's easier for collaborators to make meaningful, useful contributions. For more information, see “[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions)."

You can use the community profile for your public repository to ensure your project has all the recommended files to help people use and contribute to your project. For more information, see “[About community profiles for public repositories](github/building-a-strong-community/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories)."

](/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/managing-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-project)."
{% endif %}

#### Managing project boards
You can use project boards to organize your work with issues and pull requests and manage your workflow across repositories. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. Project boards give you the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs. For more information, see "[About project boards](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)."

#### Managing notifications
Notifications provide updates about the activity on {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} you've subscribed to or participated in. If you're no longer interested in a conversation, you can unsubscribe, unwatch, or customize the types of notifications you'll receive in the future. For more information, see “[About notifications](/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-notifications)."
