## Part 1: Configuring your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account
As the first steps in starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}, you will need to create a user account or log into your existing account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, create an organization, and set up billing. 

### Creating an organization and signing up for {% data variables.product.prodname_team %}
Before creating an organization, you will need to create a user account or log in to your existing {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account. For more information, see "[Signing up for a new {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account](/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)". 

Once your user account is set up, you can create an organization. When you choose to create a new organization, you will be asked to pick a plan for your organization. This is where you can choose a {% data variables.product.prodname_team %} subscription for your organization. For more information, see "[Creating a new organization from scratch](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)".

### Managing billing for an organization
You must manage billing settings, payment method, and paid features and products for each of your personal accounts and organizations separately. You can switch between settings for your different accounts using the context switcher in your settings. For more information, see "[Switching between settings for your different accounts](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/about-billing-on-github#switching-between-settings-for-your-different-accounts)".

Your organization's billing settings page allows you to manage settings like your payment method, billing cycle and billing email, or view information such as your subscription, billing date and payment history. You can also view and upgrade your storage and GitHub Actions minutes. For more information on managing your billing settings, see "[Managing your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} billing settings](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings)".

{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} sends receipts and other billing-related information to your organization' billing email. For more information, see "[Setting your organization's billing email](/billing/managing-your-github-billing-settings/setting-your-billing-email#setting-your-organizations-billing-email)".

Only organization members with the *owner* or *billing manager* role can access or change billing settings for your organization. A billing manager is a user who manages the billing settings for your organization and does not use a paid license in your organization's subscription. For more information on adding a billing manager to your organization, see "[Adding a billing manager to your organization](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization)".
### About organizations
Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and administrative features. For more information on the features of organizations, see "[About organizations](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations#terms-of-service-and-data-protection-for-organizations)".

Organization members can stay up-to-date with recent activity or keep track of issues and pull requests by visiting the organization dashboard. For more information, see "[About your organization dashboard](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-your-organization-dashboard)".
