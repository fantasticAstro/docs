## About accessibility settings

{% data variables.product.product_name %} includes a variety of keyboard shortcuts so that you can perform actions across the site without using your mouse to navigate. While shortcuts are useful to save time, they can sometimes make {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} harder to use and less accessible, especially in the case of single key or character key shortcuts.

All keyboard shortcuts are enabled by default on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, but you can choose to disable character key shortcuts in your accessibility settings. This setting does not affect keyboard shortcuts provided by your web browser, such as those used for navigation, or shortcuts that use a modifier key such as `control` or `command`.
