### Account Types

GitHub provides two types of Enterprise products:

- **GitHub Enterprise Cloud**
- **GitHub Enterprise Server**

The main difference between the products are that GitHub Enterprise Server is hosted by GitHub.

Within the GitHub Enterprise Server product, there are two different types of account that can be used:

- A single org account, for example https://github.com/github, that uses GHEC
- An enterprise account on GHEC that contains multiple orgs

In either scenario, your users will use their own self-created user account and you'll invite them.

#### Choosing the type of account

#### Differences

## Org account

### Setting up an organization account with access to GHEC

#### Creating or upgrading an organization account

To use an organization account with GHEC, you will first need to create an organization. When prompted to choose a plan, select "Enterprise". For more information, see "[Creating a new organization from scratch](/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)."


#### Billing for GHES

When you choose to use an organization account with GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you'll first have access to a [14-day trial](/get-started/signing-up-for-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud). If you don't purchase GitHub Enterprise or GitHub Team before your trial ends, your organization will be downgraded to GitHub Free and lose access to any advanced tooling and features that are only included with paid products. For more information, see "[Finishing your trial](/get-started/signing-up-for-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud#finishing-your-trial)."

If you do decide to purchase GHEC, you'll need to set up your billing account.
