Anyone who contributes to an open source project and has a bank account in a supported region is eligible to become a sponsored developer. Contributions include but are not limited to bug reports, issue triage, code, documentation, leadership, business development, project management, mentorship, and design. If you live in a region that isn't already supported by {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_sponsors }}, you can sign up for the waitlist to participate in the beta of {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_sponsors }}. To see if {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_sponsors }} is available in your area, see [the list of supported regions](https://github.com/sponsors#regions).
