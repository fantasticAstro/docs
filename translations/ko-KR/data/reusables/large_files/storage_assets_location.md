By default, the {{ site.data.variables.large_files.product_name_long }} client stores large assets on the same server that hosts the Git repository. When {{ site.data.variables.large_files.product_name_short}} is enabled on the {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_ghe_server }} appliance, large assets are stored on the data partition in `/data/user/storage`.
