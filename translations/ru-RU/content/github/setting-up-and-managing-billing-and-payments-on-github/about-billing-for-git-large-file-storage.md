### About billing for {{ site.data.variables.large_files.product_name_long }}

{{ site.data.reusables.large_files.free-storage-bandwidth-amount }} {{ site.data.reusables.large_files.does_not_carry }}

{{ site.data.reusables.large_files.owner_quota_only }}

### Purchasing additional storage and bandwidth

Additional storage and bandwidth is offered in a single data pack. One data pack costs {{ site.data.variables.large_files.pack_monthly_price }}, and provides a monthly quota of {{ site.data.variables.large_files.pack_monthly_bandwidth }} for bandwidth and {{ site.data.variables.large_files.pack_monthly_storage }} for storage. You can purchase as many data packs as you need. For example, if you need 150 GB of storage, you'd buy three data packs.

Purchasing data packs for {{ site.data.variables.large_files.product_name_short }} is independent of any other paid feature or product on {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }}.

### Downgrading storage and bandwidth

If you downgrade your number of additional data packs, your changes will take effect on your next billing date.
