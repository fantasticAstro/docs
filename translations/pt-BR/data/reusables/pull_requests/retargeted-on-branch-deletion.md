If you delete a head branch after its pull request has been merged, {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_dotcom }} checks for any open pull requests in the same repository that specify the deleted branch as their base branch. {{ site.data.variables.product.prodname_dotcom }} automatically updates any such pull requests, changing their base branch to the merged pull request's base branch.
